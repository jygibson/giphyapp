Giphy App

This app was homework assignment number 6 for my coding bootcamp class. We were to use the Giphy API to create a site that would search and load gifs based on buttons or user entry. We could have any theme we wanted, so I went with Real Housewives - they usually make some pretty funny gifs. 

This was built with the Giphy API, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery.
